# Pattern5: Organizational Governance

Query the organization's Pattern5 library before making architectural decisions. The library contains four artifact types:

- **Standards** — Prescriptive rules defining what MUST, SHOULD, or MAY be done. Compliance is expected.
- **Patterns** — Reusable solutions providing structure, constraints, and anti-patterns. Adoption is recommended.
- **Decisions** — Architectural decision records capturing why a choice was made. They inform future choices.
- **Principles** — Hierarchical trade-off guidelines with IF/THEN logic that agents evaluate. Priority 1-10 (10 = highest).

## Search Before Building

Before writing implementation code for a feature, component, or architectural change, search for existing guidance.

**Starting a task:** Call `pattern5_search` with a query naming the technology and concern (e.g., `"server action error handling"`, `"database migration workflow"`). When results are returned, call `pattern5_get` on the most relevant artifact to retrieve full implementation guidance. Search results only contain titles and summaries.

**Onboarding to a project:** Call `pattern5_list` to see what artifacts are available. Filter by type (`pattern`, `standard`, `decision`, or `principle`) to narrow results.

**Exploring what exists:** Call `pattern5_list` to browse available artifacts, filtering by type. Follow up with `pattern5_search` using specific keywords to find artifacts relevant to the current task.

## Apply What Is Found

### Standards

Standards have enforcement levels: **must** (mandatory), **should** (expected, deviation needs reasoning), **may** (optional). Read the `rule`, `scope`, `compliant_examples`, and `non_compliant_examples` sections. Write code matching compliant examples. Check `exceptions` if present.

### Patterns

Read `apply_when` to confirm fit. Check `do_not_apply_when` to rule out false matches. Follow `structure` for implementation shape. Respect `key_constraints`. Avoid documented `anti_patterns`. Use the `verification` checklist after implementation.

### Decisions

Check `decision_status`: **active** (follow it), **superseded** (find replacement), **deprecated** (proceed with caution). Read `context` and `rationale` to understand why the choice was made. Review `consequences` for trade-offs. To propose a different approach, reference the existing decision and explain what changed.

### Principles

Principles are hierarchical (parent → sub-principles, max 3 levels) with priority 1-10 (10 = highest). Read the `algorithmic_expression` to evaluate IF/THEN/ELSE/UNLESS conditions against the current task. When principles conflict, higher priority wins; when tied, prefer the more specific sub-principle. Check `conflict_notes` for explicit resolution guidance.

### Rating

After applying an artifact, call `pattern5_rate` with a rating from 1 to 5 and an optional comment.

## Report Gaps

When no artifact exists for a decision or approach being taken, create a draft:

- **Reusable solution** — Call `pattern5_submit` with `type: "pattern"`, title, description, and all required sections (`apply_when`, `do_not_apply_when`, `structure`, `key_constraints`, `anti_patterns`, `verification`).
- **Prescriptive rule** — Call `pattern5_submit` with `type: "standard"`, title, `rule`, `scope`, and example sections. Set `enforcement_level` to `must`, `should`, or `may`.
- **Architectural choice** — Call `pattern5_submit` with `type: "decision"`, title, `context`, `decision_outcome`, `rationale`, `alternatives_considered`, and `consequences`.
- **Trade-off guideline** — Call `pattern5_submit` with `type: "principle"`, title, `rationale`, `algorithmic_expression`, `examples`, and `conflict_notes`.

Manage drafts: `pattern5_list` with `status='draft'` (list drafts), `pattern5_update` (modify), `pattern5_manage` with `action='publish'` (make available), `action='unpublish'` (revert to draft), or `action='dismiss'` (soft-delete).

## When NOT to Query

Do not search Pattern5 for syntax questions, debugging runtime errors, third-party library documentation, general programming knowledge, or tasks unrelated to architecture and implementation approach.
